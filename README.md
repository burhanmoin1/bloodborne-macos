# Bloodborne MacOS

Hey, I’m Burhan Moin, a full-stack developer and software engineer from
Pakistan. I got into Mac gaming after buying my first Mac, an M1 Pro, last
year. I tried Bloodborne through shadPS4, but on my machine it was too slow to
enjoy. The work on the Bloodborne PC port by
[Supermedo](https://github.com/Supermedo/bloodborne_pc) and
[deadinside28](https://github.com/deadinside28/bloodborne_pc) gave me a way to
try a different route.

This project keeps the port’s familiar launcher and runs it through the
CrossOver Wine runner, with Mesa KosmicKrisp translating Vulkan to Metal. I’ve
reached gameplay on my M1 Pro with 16 GB of memory. This is an early community
build, and I’m hoping other Mac users can help me improve it over time. The
app is unofficial and is not affiliated with Sony, FromSoftware, CodeWeavers,
or the port’s authors.

## Version 0.1.0

This is the first release, not a promise of consistent performance yet. On my
M1 Pro, gameplay has ranged from around 15 to 30 FPS depending on the area and
settings. Low frame rates can make the game feel like slow motion, and I’ve
noticed occasional audio crackling. A full playthrough and 60 FPS at 1080p have
not been verified. Reports from other Macs will help show what works and what
needs attention.

## What it does

The app uses the existing Tkinter interface and detects installed CrossOver
versions in `/Applications` and `~/Applications`, including stable and preview
installations. Choose a detected CrossOver runner in the app and select your
own Bloodborne game folder. You don’t need to create a bottle or add the EXE
to CrossOver by hand; the launcher starts CrossOver’s Wine runner directly and
keeps its compatibility data in the app’s own support folder.

The Mac interface offers FSR 3.1, TAA, and Off. NVIDIA DLSS and FSR 4 options
from the Windows launcher are not shown because they are not suitable for the
Apple Silicon graphics path used here.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac with Rosetta 2.
- macOS 26 or newer for the Metal 4 features used by KosmicKrisp.
- CrossOver. CrossOver 26.3 is the version I used for the gameplay report.
- Your own legally obtained Bloodborne CUSA03173 game dump, with `eboot.bin`.

## Download and launch

Download **Bloodborne-MacOS-0.1.0.dmg** from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/burhanmoin1/bloodborne-macos/releases)
page. Open the DMG and drag **Bloodborne MacOS.app** to Applications. Start
the app, select the folder containing `eboot.bin` under **Game & effects**,
choose a detected CrossOver version on the Play page, and press **PLAY**.

On first launch, the app asks before downloading the verified Bloodborne PC
port runtime and the Vulkan/KosmicKrisp components (about 150 MB total). It
does not include or download the game itself. The launcher, runtime, saves,
settings, and compatibility data are kept separately from your game folder at:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Bloodborne macOS/
```

This release is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. If Gatekeeper blocks it,
Control-click the app in Finder, choose **Open**, then confirm once.

## Current limitations

- Performance varies by scene, settings, CrossOver version, and Mac. My M1 Pro
  has reached about 30 FPS in some areas and dropped to about 15 FPS in others.
- Low FPS can make gameplay feel slow. I’ve also heard slight audio crackling.
- A complete playthrough and stable 1080p/60 FPS have not been confirmed.
- Online play, mods, and optional patches come from the Windows port and have
  not been fully checked through CrossOver.
- The first release supports the pinned Bloodborne PC port v1.6 runtime. The
  launcher checks its executable hash and stops if it finds an unknown build.

The app downloads the Windows runtime and graphics components on first use,
checks their published SHA-256 values, and extracts the needed files locally.
They are not committed to this repository. The launcher log is under the
Application Support folder shown above, inside `compatdata/bloodborne/`.

## Help and contribute

If you try the app, please join the
[Bloodborne MacOS Discord](https://discord.gg/zTPg9kH4h), share how it runs on
your Mac, and let me know what breaks. Include your Mac chip and memory,
macOS and CrossOver versions, game area, graphics settings, and approximate
FPS when reporting a problem. Please don’t post game files or your game dump.

If the project is useful to you, a GitHub star helps other Mac players find
it. Donations are optional and help me save toward a more capable Mac and a
monitor so I can keep working on the project. For USDT on BNB Smart Chain

## Build from source

You’ll need an Apple Silicon Mac, Python 3.13 with Tk support, and MinGW-w64.
Then run:

```sh
brew install mingw-w64
./build_macos.sh
./package_dmg.sh
```

The app is built at `dist/Bloodborne MacOS.app`; the DMG is
`dist/Bloodborne-MacOS-0.1.0.dmg`. `BB_APP_VERSION` can be set when building a
different version. For source development, double-click
`Launch Bloodborne.command` to open the same launcher.
